# My Agent Skills (read "Slash Commands")
Collection of agent slash commands for me. If you find some useful, feel free to take.

In fact, these skills used to be mostly slash commands for Claude Code. But then
Anthropic decided to merge slash code into skills. So I call skills but they are
actually just slash commands, that I manually execute. 

For those who don't know how they differ, skills were designed to be used automatically
by an agent, whereas slash commands are meant to be invocked manually by users by typing
these command, much like shell commands.
